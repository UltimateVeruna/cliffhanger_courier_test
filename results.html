  <h1>Trait Descriptions</h1>
  <h3>Sense of wonder</h3>
  <p>The restless hunger for what lies beyond the veil. You are drawn to mysteries that haunt the edges of understanding. You see the world as full of possibilities. You’re drawn to new ideas, you express yourself with creative bridge ideas, and take uncharted paths. Letters, stamps, and strangers all carry stories waiting to be explored.</p>
 <h3>Steadiness of climb</h3>
  <p>You take pride in doing things right — with care, consistency, and heart. Whether delivering a single letter or managing a route, you show up with quiet reliability and focused attention. ou push forward through hardship and doubt, knowing the ascent is long, steep, and sometimes lonely.</p>
 <h3>Sense of wonder</h3>
  <p>A fierce, flickering flame amid the cold dark - you light up around people. A wave, a smile, a quick chat - these small moments energize you. You bring warmth to your route, turning daily deliveries into daily connections.</p>
 <h3>Kind heart</h3>
  <p>You’re tuned in to others. Thoughtful, patient, and generous, you go out of your way to make people feel seen — whether it’s saving a package from the rain or noticing when someone needs a little extra care. Compassion shaped by scars, a fragile armor protecting a well of fierce loyalty and aching tenderness. You offer care even when it risks breaking you.</p>
 <h3>Inner storm</h3>
  <p> A turbulent tempest raging within - waves of doubt, fear, and unrest crash endlessly beneath your surface, shaping who you are and how you fight to survive.You feel things deeply - both the weight and wonder of the world. Challenges may shake you, but they also sharpen your empathy and insight. You understand the emotional layers beneath every letter you carry.</p>

Imagination and precision swirl inside you like a storm trapped in a flask. You’re the kind of courier the company parades around, but quietly fears. Your ideas get results, but they also get people hurt. You dream in diagrams and nightmares, and both involve cliffs.";
